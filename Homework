Unfortunately, I couldn't find the Famitracker album among my chiptune collections, but there is a lot to be found on youtube anyways. :c

As for our graphics engine, I believe it is within our means to make use of normal mapping.
Perhaps something like this: https://www.codeandweb.com/spriteilluminator/download ?
Using that particular software isn't necessary, but it has good documentation to understand the theory and practice of normal mapping for sprites

As for our programmers, we're going to need an event tracker. Unity has one built in, but I recommend playing around with it and generating custom events.
Otherwise, making a custom event system is kinda fun anyways
We're going to need a grid to bind environment object to, in the very least; and an idea of how we want to handle collisions.

Do we have an idea of what we want to the combat to consist of, yet?
I'd personally recommend something similar to a side-scrolling Crashlands (https://youtu.be/cPN5oVwo45o) with emphasis on telegraphing enemy attacks

Also, we're all going to need to sync github with unity on our workstations. It's kind of a pain, but luckily it won't matter until we're further along the planning stage
