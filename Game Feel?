So ive been doing alot of thinking on what the game feel should be like and how most things should work. 
i stumbled uppon this video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKDIvk7hrkA
its a comparison between the original Megaman games and Megaman X
this video really got me thinking about the feel of the game and the approach we should take and i belive it would be best to use this 
"Formula" if we can
What i mean by "Formula" is the teaching tools and progression like gameplay. i belive for the genre we've picked this system could work
quite well.

Please let me know what your thoughts are on the Whatsapp chat or on comments here. Everyone has been pretty quiet and im hoping
this doesnt turn into an abandoned project :/ i know other groups have already begun things like animation and i belive one group already
has completed their physics and im not sure we have really started anything so i belive we should all get together into one enviorment
to work on this.

Thanks
