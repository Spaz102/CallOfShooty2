~~~ Loose ideas ~~~
- Each weapon adds its own kind of double jump, or similarly effective options


~~~ Core game loop ~~~
- Small levels
  - Different win conditions
- Different weapons -> Different mobility -> Different ways to beat levels

~~~ Setting ~~~
- Bounty hunter/scavenger in sci-fi world

~~~ Art direction ~~~
- Cool colours for background/terrain
- Neutrals for characters
- Warm colours for attacks and hazards, even if just highlights

~~~ Actual todos ~~~
- Weapon sprites (say 16x16?)
  - Swords, spears, huuuuge hammers, whatever strikes your fancy, something thoroughly ridiculous, shield
- Background textures
- Low-poly 3d models? (Specifically for cell-shading, if there are differences)
  - Torso, head, hands, and feet
- Figure out skeleton animations (Use essentially as animated sprites, but with 3d models instead of images)
  - (Normally, physics and game-state informs what sprites to display, so it would just display/pose models instead)
- Concept sketches?
- Interface concept sketches (Menus, main display)
- Weapon unlock order, overall structure of player progression/pacing
- Git structure
- Physics playground
- Map display proof-of-concept (scrolling, loading)
- (Particle/lighting) effects proof of concept
- Map editor
- Ai playground
- Mario 3 style world map

- Google doc for task management

~~~ Planning ~~~
- Mobility styles per weapon? character? class?
  - Shield: surfing? Bypassing hazards?
  - Piston-punch: high-jump, wall jump
  - Spear: dragoon-style high jump, or helicopter spin?
  - Daggers (Limited throwable?): Horizontal dash
  - Hammer: Thor-style momentum-carrying throw?
  - Sword (default/beginner weapon??)

- list of player skills to be tested
  - Walljumping? reflex?? precision? timing? obstacle-specific? combat?
