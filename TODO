Make TODO file

~~~ Loose ideas ~~~
- 


~~~ Core game loop ~~~
- Small levels
  - Different win conditions
- Get stuff, get more powerful?

~~~ Actual todos ~~~
- Weapon sprites (say 16x16?)
  - Swords, spears, huuuuge hammers, whatever strikes your fancy, something thoroughly ridiculous, shield
- Low-poly 3d models? (Specifically for cell-shading, if there are differences)
- Figure out skeleton animations (Use essentially as animated sprites, but with 3d models instead of images)
  - (Normally, physics and game-state informs what sprites to display, so it would just display/pose models instead)
- Paper doll placeholders
- Concept sketches?
- Progression/artifacts?
- Git structure
- Physics playground
- Map display proof-of-concept (scrolling, loading)
- Effects proof of concept
- Map editor
- Ai playground
- World map?? (meatboy style? mario 3 style? n++ style? mmo style?)

- Google doc for task management

~~~ Planning ~~~
- Mobility styles per weapon? character? class?
  - Shield: surfing?
  - 

- list of player skills to be tested
  - Walljumping? reflex?? precision? timing? obstacle-specific? combat?
  
- Level design workflow
  -
